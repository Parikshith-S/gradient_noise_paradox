# gradient_noise_paradox
Investigating the "Gradient Noise Paradox" in AI Safety: A study on the conflict between Differential Privacy (DP-SGD) and Adversarial Training. Uses a custom "Shadow Model" pipeline to synchronize Opacus with PGD attacks, demonstrating how privacy-preserving noise systematically degrades model robustness. #Robustness #AISafety
